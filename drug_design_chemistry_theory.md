### Chesmitry Theory of Drug Design

**Intoduction**

<span style="color: red;">**Medicinal chemistry**</span> is the science that deals with the discovery and design of new therapeutic chemicals or biochemicals and their development into useful medicines.

<span style="color: red;">**Medicines**</span> are the substances used to treat diseases.

<span style="color: red;">**Drugs**</span> are the molecules used in medicines or as components in medicines to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease.

note that drugs are not
generally discovered. What is more likely discovered is
known as a lead compound (or lead).
The lead is a proto-
type compound that has a number of attractive character-
istics, including the desired biological or pharmacological
activity, but may have other undesirable characteristics,point where a drug
candidate, a compound worthy of extensive biological and
pharmacological studies, is identified, and then a clinical
drug, a compound ready for clinical trials, is developed.

**History**

Sulfa drugs became the first effective 
systemic antibacterial medicines and were widely used in the 1930s.

1940s â€“ Penicillin, discovered earlier by Alexander Fleming (1928) but developed into a practical drug during WWII by British and American scientists, began replacing sulfa drugs for many infections due to its broader spectrum and fewer side effects.

here instead of R we have NH2 this also can be combetative inhibitor for PABA.

The original mold was **Penicillium notatum**, a strain that
gave a relatively low yield of penicillin. It was replaced by
**Penicillium chrysogenum**
